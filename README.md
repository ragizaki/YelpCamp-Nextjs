# Yelp Camp (Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, SQL Stack)

This is a remastered version of my original Yelp Camp application, using Next.js and Prisma to learn the stack. I've rarely used ORM's before, particularly Prisma, but the idea of mapping databases to JavaScript objects really interested me and I wanted to give it a try. I'll be updating this README occasionally with updates of my ideas, what I think of Prisma, and incoming features.
